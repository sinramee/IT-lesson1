<h1 class="wp-block-heading">What is CSS?</h1>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">Overview: First steps</a></li>



<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/Getting_started">Next</a></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS">CSS</a></strong>&nbsp;(Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><th>Prerequisites:</th><td>Basic computer literacy,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software">basic software installed</a>, basic knowledge of&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files">working with files</a>, and HTML basics (study&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a>.)</td></tr><tr><th>Objective:</th><td>To learn what CSS is.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a>&nbsp;module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser&#8217;s default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS/html-example.png" alt="The default styles used by a browser"/></figure>



<p>However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS, you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.</p>



<p>For more on browser/default styles, check out the following video:https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/spK_S0HfzFw</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what_is_css_for"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#what_is_css_for">What is CSS for?</a></h2>



<p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<strong>document</strong>&nbsp;is usually a text file structured using a markup language —&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a>&nbsp;is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SVG">SVG</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML">XML</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Presenting</strong>&nbsp;a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience.&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser">Browsers</a>, like&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mozilla_Firefox">Firefox</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Google_Chrome">Chrome</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Microsoft_Edge">Edge</a>, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;A browser is sometimes called a&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a>, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user agents we think of when talking about CSS, however, they are not the only ones. There are other user agents available, such as those that convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs to be printed.</p>



<p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">color</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size">size</a>&nbsp;of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Column_layouts">turning a single column of text into a layout</a>&nbsp;with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations">animation</a>. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css_syntax"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#css_syntax">CSS syntax</a></h2>



<p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>



<p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>



<p>CSSCopy to Clipboard</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}
</code></pre>



<ul>
<li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector">selector</a>. This&nbsp;<em>selects</em>&nbsp;the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">h1</a>).</li>



<li>We then have a set of curly braces&nbsp;<code>{ }</code>.</li>



<li>Inside the braces will be one or more&nbsp;<strong>declarations</strong>, which take the form of&nbsp;<strong>property</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;pairs. We specify the property (<code>color</code>&nbsp;in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (<code>red</code>&nbsp;in this example).</li>



<li>This example contains two declarations, one for&nbsp;<code>color</code>&nbsp;and the other for&nbsp;<code>font-size</code>. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">h1</a>&nbsp;in this case), then a value that we&#8217;d like to give the property.</li>
</ul>



<p>CSS&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Property/CSS">properties</a>&nbsp;have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the&nbsp;<code>color</code>&nbsp;property, which can take various&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#color">color values</a>. We also have the&nbsp;<code>font-size</code>&nbsp;property. This property can take various&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#numbers_lengths_and_percentages">size units</a>&nbsp;as a value.</p>



<p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>



<p>CSSCopy to Clipboard</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}

p {
  color: black;
}
</code></pre>



<p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget or when you want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You can find links to all the CSS property pages (along with other CSS features) listed on the MDN&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS reference</a>. Alternatively, you should get used to searching for &#8220;mdn&nbsp;<em>css-feature-name</em>&#8221; in your favorite search engine whenever you need to find out more information about a CSS feature. For example, try searching for &#8220;mdn color&#8221; and &#8220;mdn font-size&#8221;!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css_modules"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#css_modules">CSS modules</a></h2>



<p>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into&nbsp;<em>modules</em>. You&#8217;ll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders">Backgrounds and Borders</a>&nbsp;module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and features it contains. In that module, you will also find a link to&nbsp;<em>Specifications</em>&nbsp;that defines the technology (also see the section below).</p>



<p>At this stage, you don&#8217;t need to worry too much about how CSS is structured; however, it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things, and is therefore, probably in the same specification.</p>



<p>For a specific example, let&#8217;s go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color"><code>background-color</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-color"><code>border-color</code></a>&nbsp;properties to be defined in this module. And you&#8217;d be right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css_specifications"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#css_specifications">CSS specifications</a></h2>



<p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or &#8220;specs&#8221;), which are published by standards organizations (such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C">W3C</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WHATWG">WHATWG</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ECMA">ECMA</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Khronos">Khronos</a>) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.</p>



<p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSS Working Group</a>. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There are also other people, known as&nbsp;<em>invited experts</em>, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.</p>



<p>New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group — sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser today!</p>



<p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. Nevertheless, it is worth knowing that these specs exist and understanding the relationship between the CSS you are using, the browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="browser_support_information"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#browser_support_information">Browser support information</a></h2>



<p>After a CSS feature has been specified, then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented the feature. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen. We&#8217;ll look at this process more in the lesson&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works">How CSS works</a>. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able to check implementation status is useful.</p>



<p>The browser support status is shown on every MDN CSS property page in a table named &#8220;Browser compatibility&#8221;. Consult the information in that table to check if the property can be used on your website. For an example, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#browser_compatibility">browser compatibility table for the CSS&nbsp;<code>font-family</code>&nbsp;property</a>.</p>



<p>Based on your requirements, you can use the browser compatibility table to check how this property is supported across various browsers, or check if your specific browser and the version you have support the property, or if there are any caveats you should be aware of for the browser and version you are using.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>&nbsp;is a lightweight, interpreted&nbsp;<strong>programming</strong>&nbsp;language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java.&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript</strong>&nbsp;is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why to Learn Javascript</h2>



<p><strong>Javascript</strong>&nbsp;is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:</p>



<ul>
<li>Javascript is the most popular&nbsp;<strong>programming language</strong>&nbsp;in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</li>



<li>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</li>



<li>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</li>



<li>JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.</li>



<li>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.</li>



<li>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.</li>
</ul>



<p>There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any&nbsp;<strong>programming language</strong>, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hello World using Javascript</h2>



<p>Just to give you a little excitement about&nbsp;<strong>Javascript programming</strong>, I&#8217;m going to give you a small conventional Javascript Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link</p>



<p><a href="http://tpcg.io/aMKLYm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Live Demo</a>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;script language = &#8220;javascript&#8221; type = &#8220;text/javascript&#8221;&gt; &lt;!&#8211; document.write(&#8220;Hello World!&#8221;) //&#8211;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</p>



<p>There are many useful&nbsp;<strong>Javascript frameworks</strong>&nbsp;and libraries available:</p>



<ul>
<li>Angular</li>



<li>React</li>



<li>jQuery</li>



<li>Vue.js</li>



<li>Ext.js</li>



<li>Ember.js</li>



<li>Meteor</li>



<li>Mithril</li>



<li>Node.js</li>



<li>Polymer</li>



<li>Aurelia</li>



<li>Backbone.js</li>
</ul>



<p>It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks and libraries. The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Applications of Javascript Programming</h2>



<p>As mentioned before,&nbsp;<strong>Javascript</strong>&nbsp;is one of the most widely used&nbsp;<strong>programming languages</strong>&nbsp;(Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it&#8217;s presence in almost every area of software development. I&#8217;m going to list few of them here:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Client side validation</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.</li>



<li><strong>Manipulating HTML Pages</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.</li>



<li><strong>User Notifications</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.</li>



<li><strong>Back-end Data Loading</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.</li>



<li><strong>Presentations</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.</li>



<li><strong>Server Applications</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Node JS is built on Chrome&#8217;s Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.</li>
</ul>



<p>This list goes on, there are various areas where millions of software developers are happily using Javascript to develop great websites and others softwares.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Audience</h2>



<p>This tutorial has been prepared for JavaScript beginners to help them understand the basic functionality of JavaScript to build dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prerequisites</h2>



<p>For this&nbsp;<strong>Javascript tutorial</strong>, it is assumed that the reader have a prior knowledge of HTML coding. It would help if the reader had some prior exposure to object-oriented programming concepts and a general idea on creating online applications.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/what-is-html-3.webp" alt="What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained"/></figure>



<p>HTML stands for&nbsp;<strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Web development</strong>. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Internet navigation</strong>. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Web documentation</strong>. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality, although it is now considered an official web standard. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>&nbsp;maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does HTML Work</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/html-historical-milestones.webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/html-historical-milestones.webp" alt="HTML Historical Milestones infographic" class="wp-image-38431"/></a></figure>



<p>The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.</p>



<p>HTML documents are files that end with a&nbsp;<strong>.html</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>.htm</strong>&nbsp;extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>



<p>All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three main parts of an element are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;to create a paragraph.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Content – this is the output that other users see.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example,&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;to end a paragraph.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of these three parts will create an HTML element:</p>



<p>&lt;p&gt;<strong>This</strong> is how you add a paragraph <strong>in</strong> HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</p>



<p>Another critical part of an HTML element is its attribute, which has two sections – a name and attribute value. The name identifies the additional information that a user wants to add, while the attribute value gives further specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a style element adding the color purple and the font-family verdana will look like this:</p>



<p>&lt;p style=&#8221;color:purple;font-family:verdana&#8221;&gt;<strong>This</strong> is how you add a paragraph <strong>in</strong> HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</p>



<p>Another attribute, the HTML class, is most important for development and programming. The class attribute adds style information that can work on different elements with the same class value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we will use the same style for a heading&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;h1&gt;&nbsp;and a paragraph&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;p&gt;. The style includes background color, text color, border, margin, and padding, under the class .important. To achieve the same style between&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;h1&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;p&gt;, add&nbsp;</p>



<p>class=&#8221;important&#8221;&nbsp;after each start tag:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;style&gt;</p>



<p>.important {</p>



<p>background-color: blue;</p>



<p>color: white;</p>



<p>border: 2px solid black;</p>



<p>margin: 2px;</p>



<p>padding: 2px;</p>



<p>}</p>



<p>&lt;/style&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;h1 <strong>class</strong>=&#8221;important&#8221;&gt;<strong>This</strong> is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;p <strong>class</strong>=&#8221;important&#8221;&gt;<strong>This</strong> is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>



<p>Most elements have an opening and a closing tag, but some elements do not need closing tags to work, such as empty elements. These elements do not use an end tag because they do not have content:</p>



<p>&lt;img src=&#8221;/&#8221; alt=&#8221;Image&#8221;&gt;</p>



<p>This image tag has two attributes – an&nbsp;</p>



<p>src&nbsp;attribute, the image path, and an&nbsp;</p>



<p>alt&nbsp;attribute, the descriptive text. However, it does not have content nor an end tag.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, every HTML document must start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration to inform the web browser about the document type. With HTML5, the doctype HTML public declaration will be:</p>



<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-most-used-html-tags-and-html-elements">Most Used HTML Tags and HTML Elements</h2>



<p>Currently, there are 142 HTML tags available that allow for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/html-cheat-sheet">creation of various elements</a>. Even though modern browsers no longer support some of these tags, learning all the different elements available is still beneficial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This section will discuss the most-used HTML tags and two main elements – block-level elements and inline elements.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-block-level-elements">Block-Level Elements</h3>



<p>A block-level element takes up the entire width of a page. It always starts a new line in the document. For example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element.</p>



<p>Every HTML page uses these three tags:</p>



<ul>
<li>&lt;html&gt; tag is the root element that defines the whole HTML document.</li>



<li>&lt;head&gt; tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset.</li>



<li>&lt;body&gt; tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.</li>
</ul>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;!&#8211; META INFORMATION &#8211;&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;!&#8211; PAGE CONTENT &#8211;&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>



<p>Other popular block-level tags include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Heading tags – these range from&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&lt;h6&gt;, where heading h1 is largest in size, getting smaller as they move up to h6.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Paragraph tags – are all enclosed by using the&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;tag.</li>



<li>List tags – have different variations. Use the&nbsp;&lt;ol&gt;&nbsp;tag for an ordered list, and use &lt;ul&gt; for an unordered list. Then, enclose individual list items using the&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&nbsp;tag.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inline-elements">Inline Elements</h3>



<p>An inline element formats the inner content of block-level elements, such as adding links and emphasized strings. Inline elements are most commonly used to format text without breaking the flow of the content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;tag would render an element in bold, whereas the&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;tag would show it in italics.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-create-hyperlink">Hyperlinks</a>&nbsp;are also inline elements that use an&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;a&gt;&nbsp;tag and an href attribute to indicate the link’s destination:</p>



<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;https://example.com/&#8221;&gt;Click me!&lt;/a&gt;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-html-evolution-what-differs-between-html-and-html5">HTML Evolution – What Differs Between HTML and HTML5?</h2>



<p>The first version of HTML consisted of 18 tags. Since then, each new version came with new tags and attributes added to the markup. The most significant upgrade of the language so far was the introduction of HTML5 in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main difference between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/difference-between-html-and-html5">HTML and HTML5</a>&nbsp;is that HTML5 supports new kinds of form controls. HTML5 also introduced several semantic tags that clearly describe the content, such as&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;article&gt;,&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;header&gt;, and&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;footer&gt;.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-and-cons-of-html">Pros and Cons of HTML</h2>



<p>Just like any other computer language, HTML has its strengths and limitations. Here are the pros and cons of HTML:</p>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beginner-friendly. HTML has a clean and consistent markup, as well as a shallow learning curve.</li>



<li>Support. The language is widely used, with a lot of resources and a large community behind it.</li>



<li>Accessible. It is open-source and completely free. HTML runs natively in all web browsers.</li>



<li>Flexible. HTML is easily integrable with backend languages such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/php">PHP</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-node-js">Node.js</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul>
<li>Static. The language is primarily used for static web pages. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a back-end language such as PHP.</li>



<li>Separate HTML page. Users have to create individual web pages for HTML, even if the elements are the same.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Browser compatibility. Some browsers adopt new features slowly. Sometimes older browsers don’t always render newer tags.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-are-html-css-and-javascript-related">How Are HTML, CSS, and Javascript Related</h2>



<p>HTML is used to add text elements and create the structure of content. However, it is not enough to build a professional and fully responsive website. So, HTML needs the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/css-cheat-sheet">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-javascript">&nbsp;JavaScript</a>&nbsp;to create the vast majority of website content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CSS is responsible for stylings such as background, colors, layouts, spacing, and animations. On the other hand, JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as sliders, pop-ups, and photo galleries. These three languages are the fundamentals of front-end development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-html-and-improving-your-html-knowledge">Understanding HTML and Improving Your HTML Knowledge</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/html">Learning about HTML</a>&nbsp;is a great first step for those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/become-web-developer">interested in web development</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is Photoshop?</h3>



<p>Photoshop is an image creation, graphic design and photo editing software developed by Adobe. The software provides many image editing features for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/pixel">pixel</a>-based&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/image">images</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/raster-graphics">raster</a>&nbsp;graphics and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/vector-graphics">vector graphics</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How does Photoshop work?</h3>



<p>Photoshop has been the industry&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/standard">standard</a>&nbsp;image manipulation program for so long that its name has become a verb. It is common parlance to say that an image has been &#8220;photoshopped,&#8221; or even just &#8220;shopped,&#8221; meaning that it&#8217;s been edited or manipulated.</p>



<p>It uses a layer-based editing system that enables&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/raster">raster image</a>&nbsp;creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency.</p>



<p>Layers can also act as masks or filters, changing underlying colors. Shadows and other effects can be added to the layers.</p>



<p>Adobe promotes Photoshop as a tool for professionals. However, beginners can use Photoshop as well with many helpful tutorials on the market that train users in how to use Photoshop&#8217;s various features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/photoshop-f_mobile.png" alt="Adobe Photoshop" style="width:838px;height:470px" width="838" height="470"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are Photoshop&#8217;s features?</h3>



<p>Photoshop comes with a multitude of features, fonts, effects, and brush or pen tools. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Brushes</strong>&nbsp;are one of the most popular tools in Photoshop. They can be used for various effects, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theserverside.com/definition/compositing">compositing</a>, painting, erasing and retouching images.</li>



<li><strong>The Clone Stamp&nbsp;</strong>allows you to copy pixels from one area of an image and paste them into another area. This is useful for repairing damaged or corrupt images.</li>



<li><strong>The Healing Brush&nbsp;</strong>is similar to the Clone Stamp, but it blends the copied pixels with the surrounding pixels for a more natural look.</li>



<li><strong>The History Brush</strong>&nbsp;allows you to revert an image to a previous state. This is useful for undoing mistakes or going back to a point in your workflow where you were happy with the image.</li>



<li><strong>Blur&nbsp;</strong>blurs the pixels in an image, making them less distinct. This can be used to create a soft, dreamy look or reduce the appearance of wrinkles and other imperfections.</li>



<li><strong>Sharpen&nbsp;</strong>does the opposite of Blur, making pixels more distinct. This can be useful for making an image appear more transparent or creating a more dramatic effect.</li>



<li><strong>Dodge and Burn&nbsp;</strong>are used to lighten or darken areas of an image. These are commonly used in photo retouching to make subjects appear more defined.</li>



<li><strong>The Sponge tool</strong>&nbsp;can either absorb or release color from an image. This is useful for correcting colors that are too light or too dark.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is the most recent version of Photoshop?</h3>



<p>The most recent version, Photoshop 2022 (desktop), is version 23.3.1 released in April 2022, while Adobe released the latest cloud version in October of 2021.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new/2022-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newest edition</a>&nbsp;of Photoshop updated copy-paste support from Illustrator to Photoshop, making it easier to move text layers and other typographic properties. Adobe has also improved the quality along edges in objects in its Sky Replacement feature. More enhancements include the addition of multithreaded and GPU compositing options for faster performance, the ability to search cloud documents in recents and improvements in Photoshop&#8217;s saving preferences. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Adobe has also removed the camera shake reduction function due to incompatibly with newer development platforms and the quick share feature due to lack of use. The company has, however, added support for additional cameras and lenses.</p>



<p>Recent versions of Photoshop also include features such as an object selection tool, a properties panel, updated keyboard shortcuts for paint and brush, an enhanced transform warp and a background image removal option.</p>



<p>They also incorporate some administrative functions such as automation features to reduce the need for repetitive tasks.</p>



<p>Photoshop&#8217;s feature set can be further expanded through Photoshop plug-ins which are programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that can run inside and offer new or enhanced features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who uses Photoshop?</h3>



<p>Photographers, graphic designers, web designers, Discord emoji creators and meme-makers all use Photoshop to edit images, create new high-quality images, or both.</p>



<p>The software is available for a monthly fee from Adobe or as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud subscription service.</p>



<p>Adobe Photoshop Elements is an alternative to traditional Photoshop. It is a graphics editor for photographers, image editors and hobbyists. It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer features and a simpler user interface.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/GIMP-GNU-Image-Manipulation-Program">GIMP</a>&nbsp;is an open source alternative to Photoshop that works on macOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux.</p>
